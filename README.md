This project taught me how to create a web server that can handle requests from clients, execute programs using CGI, store and retrieve information using cookies and session management, and accept file uploads from users. And let me tell you, it's been a wild ride! I feel like I've unlocked the secrets of the web, and I'm ready to take on the world (or at least build some really cool websites). Here's a summary of what it took me to get here:

> I learned how the web works under the hood, using sockets to create connections between web clients and servers. And let me tell you, it's not just a pretty face - the web has some serious technical chops! For example, I learned about poll, an event-driven system call that can handle multiple connections at once. Talk about efficiency!

> I also learned about HTTP, the protocol that makes the web work. HTTP allows clients (like your web browser) to request information from web servers, and for web servers to send back a response. And I learned about web servers, the programs that listen for requests from clients and send back the appropriate response.

> Next, I learned about CGI, a way for a web server to execute programs or scripts in response to requests from clients. This opens up all sorts of possibilities, like generating dynamic content or storing user data.

> I also learned about cookies, those little pieces of data that web servers can store on your device. Cookies are useful for storing information about your preferences or activity on a website. And with session management, a web server can track your activity over multiple requests, allowing it to provide a personalized experience.

>  I learned about file uploads, which allow users to upload files from their device to a web server. This is useful for letting users upload images or other types of content to a website.

> I learned.... no that's it , i won't bore you no more... feel free to check out the code and see for yourself!
